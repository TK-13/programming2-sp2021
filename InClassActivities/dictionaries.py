# 1. go find a cool csv that you're interested in (kaggle is a great place to look)
# 2. think about one question you'd like to answer, and write down required steps to answer it
# 3. read in csv file (I challenge you to store it in a nested dict!)
# 4. translate steps from 2 into code and see if you can answer your question
